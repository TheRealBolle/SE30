These files are a stock SE/30 ROM split up into four files and bitswapped to be used with the onboard PLCC32 FlashROM (F010 or F040) sockets.
When using the PLCC sockets make sure to bridge the two solder switches on the bottom of the board at the marked (V) position.
If a ROM SIMM is used the two ROM jumpers can be left open.
